Size matters not.

<p>
Look at me.
</p>

<p>
Judge me by my size do you?
</p>

<p>
And well you should not.
</p>

<p>
For my ally is the force, and a powerful ally it is.
</p>

<p>
Life creates it.
</p>

<p>
Makes it grow.
</p>

<p>
Itâ€™s energy surrounds us, and binds us.
</p>

<p>
Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. 
</p>

<p>
You must feel the force around you. 
</p>

<p>
Here.
</p>

<p>
Between you and me.
</p>

<p>
The tree.
</p>

<p>
The rock.
</p>

<p>
Everywhere.
</p>

<p>
Even between you and the ship.
